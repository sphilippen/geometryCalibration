# How to process with simulated and experimental data

# Simulation
Using the script in this folder, you can simulate your own flasher data.
`generate_flashers.py` simulates MCPE hit using icetray's PPC, be aware to configure PPC in such the way that you use the correct ice model.
`detectorSimulation.py` takes MCPE hits and performes the simulation of detector effects and processes the simulation data up to wavedeform 
in the same way the experimental data are handled.

# Expermintal Data
